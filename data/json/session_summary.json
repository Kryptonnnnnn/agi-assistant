  "summary": "1. The user attempted to transcribe audio using a Whisper model with Python, specifically by invoking `python main.py` which resulted in 'command not found: python' error because they likely forgot that their shell is running on zsh and the correct way to invoke Python from within an activated virtual environment might be necessary. To fix this issue, we need to make sure both commands (activating venv first then invoking `python`) are done correctly in a terminal session.\n\n2.
